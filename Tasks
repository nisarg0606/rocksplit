pt1:- Create the Group service
pt2:- Create the individual expense services (can add more than two users in transaction)
    Note:-Point 2 can be managed by Group service not neccessary to have another service

pt3:- Create the Settelments Service where Settelments can be done individually or in a particular group (Can be simpler but we can have this feature)
Note:---------
User need to have other users in their list for adding them in any expensis
    (if they we added in group add all users in that group to every users list
    for example : In Group1:-
                            User1, User2, User3 added)
                            If they are not in each otherList add them
                            User1List:- User2, User3 {here It is posibility that the user2 was already in list but not user3 then just add user3}
                            User2List
(All Expenseis can be managed but expense service all other services can call/user expence services to caluclate the split or balance)



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Expense Services Thoughts and Implimentation !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Think of what paramaters are neccesary for individual balances calculation
Think how you can differenciate the expence done in group(think about all groups individually) and individual
if pt3 is implimented think how will you handle settelment of a group and individual
edit will take care of settled balance and remaning balance we cannot know which transaction was settled

Thinking about group(Initial thoughts just to add will think about edit latter):-
    I will get the
            User who paid
            User who are involved in transaction
            Groupid
            Balance
            the % of split for all individual user(Managed by Group service no matter what the type is)

    what should be returned
            the list of an object which can describe the
                Groupid
                UserId
                their balance( +/ -),
                current split
                their current group balance
                UserId (to whom they need to pay, if user is the one who paid you can keep it null)
                Temporary Transaction Id

Thinking about individual():-
    Same as Group but just no Group-Id

what expense table can look like:-
    UserId FK, GroupId(nullable) FK. their balance, their current split, transactionIdFK, UserId(who paid)FK
